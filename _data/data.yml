        tagline: "Understanding vegetation systems and whether or not they're in a steady state or heading towards a tipping point, where the positive feedback turns vast vegetation into dry savannahs, is a very cruical science for climate researchers. 
        Vegetation has many patterns which obey physical laws defined by Alan Turing in terms of bifurcations, and the goal is to use a CNN to be able to classify different vegetation states from satellite images provided by Google Earth. "
